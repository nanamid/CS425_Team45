# Nanami here. I've added the file below to .gitignore because it contains an API key.
# After an hour of somewhat contradictory feedback of whether or not it's okay to
#  include this file, I've decided to add it here since it's easy to download the
#  file from Firebase Console and give it to team members who need it.
# If you need the file, please send me a message.
